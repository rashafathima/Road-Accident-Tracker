<p>Our project aims on letting users find out hotspot zones of road traffic accidents of the selected city. It  primarily focusing on analyzing which zones of the city are more prone to accidents by considering factors  such as type of vehicle, reasons and severity and finally classify the zones as either red, green or yellow. Zones  classified as red; being the most prominent one implies that these zones have highest count of accident history,  followed by yellow having the moderate and green having the least count. Primary functionality of our  application includes traversing and selection of accident information based on location attribute. Coming to the  conclusion, our application is very useful when seen from a broader perspective as it provides recently updated  information about the accident locations and accidents, to the public as well as government, so that the  individuals as well as organizations can update themselves on information related to the nearby areas prone to  accidents.
